          <b>ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE ON AND OFF CAMPUS </b> <br>
Academic performance is very dependent on the person pursuing it as the result is directly proportional to the effort one puts in. At campus they are just two places you can be, within the school, and off campus, some campus can break this by just having hostels within the school, but both places have advantages and also disadvantages some can be known to be general while some personal. Our interest would be on how they affect academic performance so we’ll list the advantages and disadvantages and then compare the one with the highest advantage and least disadvantage would be suitable.
ON CAMPUS <br>
 &nbsp;
On campus is very exciting to be in. Before we go on let just see what staying in campus hostel means, its means you would definitely have a roommate or many depending on the type of hostel, you won’t go hungry if you have good communication, little privacy, and so on. Now relating this to academic performance, having many roommates would mean you would be encountered with lots of noise in the room and it will have an effect to those who find it hard to read under noise.
Another, let me say disadvantage of staying on campus can be little privacy this disadvantage can be considered personal in a kind, because some people don’t take privacy as something significant, but since at some point they like privacy I can or we can call it general. How can this be related to academic performance, some people like it when they read alone, they tend not only to assimilate in a quite environment but in place where it’s only them.
OFF CAMPUS <br>
Off campus is fun to many as you can decide to stay alone or have has many roommates as you want, you can decide to have all the privacy in the world, but it’s a place where you have to prepare early to meet up for lectures, where you have to travel a long or short distance to school and back home and so on. So if you choose to have many roommates you must have learnt how to cope or if you don’t you must have made all preparations to surviving, and if you choose to be alone and you like reading singly, reading hasn’t gotten more exciting, there’s no problem. <br>
You can also have all the privacy you want has it’s only you or you and someone. Staying off campus might mean missing one or two lectures and also going late even if you decide to go early everyday you might still miss one or two. It also where you travel long or short distance home, it’s all dependent on the location of where you lodge, so even if you are so tired and you’ve reach the gate of the school you will have to walk or board a taxi. It would be a lie to say I have done a good job by comparing correctly as I can't do all the listing I have done some you do yours and relate.<br>
In conclusion, academic performance is generally dependent on you, some of the things named as disadvantages might not be to some people so all analysis are dependent on you because we all have different style of reading, how we concentrate, likes and dislikes, and that will definitely determine the kind of environment we want to find ourselves in Just pick the right environment, and if it’s because of one or two reasons you find yourself in an environment you don’t like, you have no order choice than to adapt to that environment, it’s never impossible to get used to a particular environment it just takes time and you can even determine the length of that time. Academic performance on or off campus depends on you.
